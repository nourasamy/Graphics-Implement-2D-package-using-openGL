# Graphics-using-openGL.

Implement 2D package which contains:

a.	Drop down list for the following algorithms

b.	Line algorithms [DDA, Midpoint and parametric]

c.	Ellipse Algorithms [Direct, polar and midpoint]

d.	Clipping using circle window and line as a clipped element 

e.	Showing your clipping step by step as GUI interface[Bonus]

f.	Convex Filling algorithm using any number of points 

g.	Implement save function for all data in screen 

h.	Implement load function for loading data from files

i.	Build a simple OpenGl scene which contains a simple object like a car or a bicycle

j.	Use keyboard clicks to control the moving of the previous object

k.	Use keyboard clicks to control the camera coordinates of the scene (zoom in or zoom out)
